# ZAN

ZAN is a Mining game server written entirely using TypeScript and JavaScript. The aim of this project is to create a game server that is both fun and easy to use, while also providing simple content development systems.

The server runs on the 435 revision of the game, which was a game update made on October 31st, 2006. There are not any plans to convert it to other versions at this time.

**ZAN is completely open-source and open to all pull requests and/or issues. Many plugins have been added by contributor pull requests and we're always happy to have more!**
